It's been a while since I've published anything serious online, so here's me using this as a chance to tell you, dear reader, what I've doing recently.

First off, a lot's changed since the last article I wrote on the web (for context, that was 2017). I've finished my degree, survived an honours thesis on [experimental biophysics](https://zoophotonics.com), and started working full time as a contractor-slash-consultant at [Itty Bitty Apps](https://www.ittybittyapps.com) â€” one of the biggest mobile app agencies in Australia (a misnomer).

Since then, I've been working on [ANZ Plus](https://www.anz.com/plus), helping redesign the customer experience for digital banking. I've also worked on a few smaller side projects in-between, like [Reveal](https://revealapp.com), or designing the branding for Melbourne's biggest [Apple developer community](https://melbournecocoaheads.com).

Outside of work, I've been running a lot, [tweeting about croissants](https://twitter.com/cjmlgrto/status/1588286759401447424), making tarts, and just a few months ago, bought my first home (don't ask me about interest rates). I'm also on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/cjmlgrto) a lot (I usually post stories nowadays) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/cjmlgrto?si=7a6fa0820fde4d9d), where I have seven playlists of the same name but with slightly different custom covers.

And if you're really interested in what I'm doing right now (as of writing), I'm spending a not-so-lazy Sunday afternoon with my girlfriend, who is also writing an article for her own newsletter.

Looking forward to the future, I'm really keen to get better at what I do, while also finding the right balance between [juggling seniority](http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) (aka managing!) and making. I'm also really interested to delve deeper into a space I'm familiar with (personal banking? amateur home-cooking?) while also honing in on a skill to get better at my craft.

Anyways, that's it for now.
