I'm a product designer and user interface engineer based in Melbourne, Australia.

Currently, I'm working on helping design the future of modern, digital banking over at [ANZ Plus](https://www.anz.com.au/plus/), as a consultant under [Itty Bitty Apps](https://www.ittybittyapps.com).

Outside of work, I'm also a [food critic](https://food-spots.com.au/), croissant enthusiast, runner, [(ex) film photographer](https://instagram.com/cjmlgrto), and amateur tart-maker.
