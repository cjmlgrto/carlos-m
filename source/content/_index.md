I'm a product designer based in Melbourne, Australia.

Currently, I'm working on redesiging modern, digital banking over at [ANZ Plus](https://www.anz.com.au/plus/), as a consultant under [Itty Bitty Apps](https://www.ittybittyapps.com). Most of my work involves product design and strategy, though I occassionally cut Swift or Kotlin and submit the odd pull request now and then.

Outside of work, I'm also a [food critic](https://food-spots.com.au/), croissant enthusiast, runner, [(ex) film photographer](https://instagram.com/cjmlgrto), and amateur tart-maker.

Also, I'm chronically online â€” feel free to say hi [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cjmlgrto) before the iceberg hits.
