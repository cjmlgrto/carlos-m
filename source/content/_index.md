I'm a product designer and user interface engineer based in Melbourne, Australia.

Currently, I'm building the future of modern, digital banking over at [ANZ Plus](https://www.anz.com.au/plus/), and designing [Reveal](https://revealapp.com), a powerful macOS app for iOS engineers.

Outside of work, I [bake tarts](https://www.tartvillain.com/), go for runs, [take film photos](https://instagram.com/cjmlgrto), and occassionally, [critique food spots](https://food-spots.com.au/).
